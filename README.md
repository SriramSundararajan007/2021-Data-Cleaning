# Worldwide Happiness analysis 

Which countries are happier and which social and economic reasons lead to the people of a country being happy.

## Data Collection

Two important factors are included in this dataset, which comes from the 2021 World Happiness Report: **Logged GDP per capita** and **Ladder score**. The logarithmic transformation of GDP per capita, a measure of economic advancement, is represented by the **Logged GDP per capita**. On a scale of 0 to 10, people rate their subjective well-being or life satisfaction using the **Ladder score**. To ensure that only full records were kept for analysis, the dataset was cleaned to address missing values in these fields. With a few significant exceptions, descriptive statistics and visualizations such as scatter plots, boxplots, and histograms show that wealthier nations typically have better life satisfaction ratings. Although there is a positive association between GDP and life satisfaction, it is not perfect, suggesting that other factors also play a role in well-being.
